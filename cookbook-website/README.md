# Cookbook group 22

This is a small note for people grading.

Instructions on running the website:
1) The zip will have the .env file but the GitLab will not since it is in .gitignore. Please use the zip version.

2) When successfully extracted from zip, create two terminals and cd to "cook-book-api" and "cookbook-client".

3) Run "npm i" on both terminals

4) Once the node_modules are finished downloading, Start the API by "npm start" followed by the same command on the client terminal.

5)A website should open on localhost in your browser.

In case you wonder why everything was deleted on the GitLab. There has been an issue with nested repos, which caused files to be uploaded wrongly (empty folders that can't be opened). After hours of research, I could not get it fixed so I wiped and re-uploaded the whole repo (had back up). Hopefully that clarifies it.

Our group wishes to thank you for providing us with the opportunity to work together and experience team development. Thank you for grading us and we hope you have a wondeful new year!
